A tool for emulating geophysical datasets including (but not limited to!) Earth System Models.

Why ESEm?
---------

While excellent tools exist for regression and emulation, and similarly for efficient calibration, there isn't a single package that makes it easy for Earth scientists to emulate and calibrate their models. ESEm provides a simple interface to do so, with a thin wrapper around familiar emulation engines and efficient sampling tools. 

ESEm uses [Iris](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Cubes to retain useful geophysical information about the data being emulated and also streamlines the typical task of co-locating models and observations for comparison using [CIS](https://cis.readthedocs.io/).

These tasks aren't just restricted to emulating and calibrating models though and can be used in any situation where regression of Earth system data is needed.
